## Introduction
Baekjoon Online Judge is a popular platform where programmers from around the world challenge themselves with diverse algorithm problems. In this repository, you will find:
- Solutions: Code implementations for various problems.
- Explanations: Detailed reasoning and commentary on the approaches used.
- Multiple Languages: Solutions in languages such as Python, C++, Java, etc.

## Problem-Solving Approach
For each problem, I typically follow these steps:
1. Understanding the Problem: Analyze the problem statement, constraints, and provided examples.
2. Designing a Strategy: Choose the appropriate algorithm and data structures.
3. Implementation: Write a clean, efficient solution.
4. Testing and Optimization: Validate the solution with multiple test cases and optimize where needed.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have a better solution, an optimization, or additional insights, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Collaboration is encouraged to build a comprehensive resource for the community.
